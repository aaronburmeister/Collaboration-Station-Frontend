# Collaboration Station - Frontend

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.
This app makes it easier to connect artists with those who need them - specifically those looking for commissioned work for their D&D/Pathfinder/RPG characters. Artists can sign up to offer their services and showcase their work, and everyone else can sign up to post requests to see if any artists are interested in doing the job!
